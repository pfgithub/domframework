style things:
- add a random thing to the class

p.realclassname.randomid

this allows people to make custom styles for your website that work past some recompiles

css animations:

```
button::create{
	transition: 0.1s something;
}
```

on create, button will have a .create.fjknfdsalnkdf class for the length of the transition. after that it will be removed
