$Component
function Loader(){
   $Init

   $Update
   

}

wait if there is a difference between init and update why not


function Loader () {
   let $a = 5;
   let $b = 6;

   $Component
   return () => {


   }

}

and have that transform

what about




function Loader () {
   let $a = 5;
   let $b = 6;

   $Component; {


   }

}

that looks nice
obv would need some prettier changes
